The Dragon's Lair

You are standing inside of a dragon's lair! The air is hot and dank. A tunnel
leads [back] the way you came. In the center of the room is a massive pile of
gold atop which a massive red dragon slumbers. Probably best not to [wake] the
dragon. If you could [slay] it, you would be a hero!
